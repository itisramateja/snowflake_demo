# EventCombo ETL Script - Security and Quality Improvements

## 🎯 Overview

I've analyzed your original EventCombo ETL script and created a significantly improved version that addresses critical security vulnerabilities and code quality issues. The improvements focus on security best practices, maintainability, and reliability.

## 🔒 Critical Security Issues Fixed

### 1. **Hardcoded Credentials Eliminated**
- **Original Issue**: Username and password were hardcoded in the script
- **Security Risk**: Credentials exposed in code, version control, and logs
- **Solution**: Implemented AWS Secrets Manager integration
- **Impact**: ✅ Zero credential exposure risk

### 2. **Proper Secrets Management**
- **Original Issue**: Secrets Manager code was commented out
- **Security Risk**: Fallback to insecure hardcoded values
- **Solution**: Full AWS Secrets Manager implementation with error handling
- **Impact**: ✅ Secure credential storage and rotation capability

### 3. **Error Message Security**
- **Original Issue**: Potential credential leakage in error messages
- **Security Risk**: Sensitive data in logs and console output
- **Solution**: Sanitized error handling that never exposes credentials
- **Impact**: ✅ No sensitive data in error outputs

     "password": "your-actual-password"
   }
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   export EVENTCOMBO_SECRET_NAME=eventcombo
   export S3_BUCKET=shc-ea-fivetran
   export AWS_REGION=us-west-2
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements_eventcombo.txt
   ```
